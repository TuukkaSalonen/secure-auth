# Logs

This directory contains the backend logs that occur during backend requests from frontend.

## Disclaimer
The logs would obviously not be publicly viewable in a real project, but I left them accessible for reviewing purposes to display what kind of information is logged.

## Data

The logs contain data about the request, such as what route was used, who did it (if logged in), was it successful or what possible errors might have happened.
